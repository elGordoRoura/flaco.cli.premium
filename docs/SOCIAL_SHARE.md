**Title:** Flaco AI PREMIUM: 10 Specialized AI Agents Running Locally (Agent Swarms, Unlimited Code Review)

**Body:**
```
Following up on my Flaco AI post - I've released the PREMIUM tier with some seriously powerful features.

**What's New in PREMIUM:**

**10 Specialized AI Agents**

Instead of one general assistant, you get domain experts:

1. **Tim** (Networking): DNS, CDN, networking protocols
2. **Craig** (Database): SQL/NoSQL optimization, schema design
3. **Jony** (Frontend): React, Vue, design systems, UI/UX
4. **Phil** (Hardware): Performance optimization, systems programming
5. **Katie** (Marketing): Growth, SEO, analytics
6. **Jeff** (DevOps): AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
7. **Bob** (Security): Security audits, compliance, cryptography
8. **Lisa** (Product): Strategy, roadmaps, user research
9. **Eddie** (Services): Microservices, APIs, event-driven architecture
10. **Flaco AI** (General): General software engineering

The system automatically routes tasks to the right expert based on context.

**Agent Swarms (The Game Changer)**

For complex tasks, multiple agents collaborate automatically:

Example: "Build a user authentication system"

The swarm assembles:
- Bob (Security) → Auth strategy and security review
- Craig (Database) → User schema, sessions
- Jony (Frontend) → Login/signup UI
- Jeff (DevOps) → Deployment, scaling

They work in parallel and synthesize results. It's wild.

**Interactive Code Review**

Unlike FREE tier (10 files max), PREMIUM has:
- Unlimited file selection
- Batch processing
- Interactive selection (ranges, individual files)
- Progress tracking across sessions

Perfect for reviewing entire subsystems.

**Other Premium Features:**

- Git workflow integration (/git status, commit, push, stats)
- Multi-project management with context switching
- Code snippets library (20+ production-ready patterns)
- Todo management with AI assistance
- Quick actions (multi-step workflows)
- Contribution statistics and activity recaps
- Custom agent creation

**Still 100% Local:**

Everything runs on your machine via Ollama:
- No cloud APIs
- No tracking
- Works offline
- Full privacy

**Installation:**

```
pipx install flaco-ai-premium

# Run with:
flaco-premium
# or
flacopro
```

**Performance:**

With qwen2.5-coder:32b, agent swarms complete complex tasks 3-5x faster than sequential approaches.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Agent routing uses embedding similarity + keyword matching
- Swarm coordination via task decomposition
- Parallel execution where possible
- Result synthesis and conflict resolution

Open source (MIT): https://github.com/RouraIO/flaco.cli.premium

Would love feedback, especially on:
1. Agent specialization effectiveness
2. Swarm coordination improvements
3. Additional agents that would be useful

AMA!

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:** Built agent swarms with Ollama - 10 specialized coding agents collaborating locally

**Body:**
```
Implemented multi-agent collaboration in Flaco AI PREMIUM using Ollama as the backend.

**The Setup:**

10 specialized agents, each with different:
- System prompts (domain expertise)
- Thinking patterns
- Response styles
- Task routing keywords

All running on local Ollama instance.

**How Agent Swarms Work:**

1. **Task Analysis**: Parse user request for complexity signals
2. **Agent Selection**: Pick 2-4 relevant agents based on domains
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break into parallel sub-tasks
4. **Parallel Execution**: Each agent handles their specialty
5. **Result Synthesis**: Combine outputs into coherent solution

**Example:**

Request: "Optimize this API for performance"

Swarm: Eddie (APIs) + Craig (Database) + Phil (Performance)

Each works on their aspect:
- Eddie: API design, caching, rate limiting
- Craig: Query optimization, indexing
- Phil: Profiling, memory optimization

Results merged into comprehensive solution.

**Challenges:**

1. **Context Management**: Each agent needs sufficient context
2. **Result Conflicts**: Sometimes agents suggest conflicting approaches
3. **Performance**: Multiple LLM calls can be slow (mitigated with smaller models)

**Solutions:**

- Shared context store
- Consensus algorithm for conflicts
- Parallel execution where possible
- 7B models for speed, 32B for quality

**Models Tested:**

Works best with:
- qwen2.5-coder:32b (best quality)
- qwen2.5-coder:7b (best speed)
- codellama:13b (good balance)

**Performance:**

Complex tasks: 3-5x faster than sequential
Simple tasks: Single agent (no swarm overhead)

**Open Source:**

GitHub: https://github.com/RouraIO/flaco.cli.premium

Would love to discuss optimization strategies with this community!

Specific questions:
1. Best models for agent collaboration?
2. Prompt engineering tips for specialized agents?
3. Better task decomposition approaches?
