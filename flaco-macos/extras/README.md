# Extras (Review Before Deleting)

This folder holds non-runtime assets that were cluttering the desktop app root. Keep or remove as needed.

Moved here:
- docs: CLAUDE.md, CODE_SIGNING.md, MIGRATIONS.md, PRIVACY_POLICY.md, PRODUCTION_READINESS.md, QUICKSTART.md, RELEASE_0.0.1.md, SOCIAL_SHARE.md, TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md, WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md, claude-tickets-mvp.md, GITHUB_RELEASE_GUIDE.md
- unused utilities: error-messages.js, tool-executor.js, tool-registry.js

If you decide an item is needed at runtime, move it back to the app root and update imports/build scripts accordingly. Otherwise, you can safely delete this folder.
