🚀 Excited to launch Flaco AI v0.0.1!

After seeing the gap between web-based AI tools and terminal AI, I built Flaco AI - a desktop app that combines the best of both worlds.

What makes it different:

🔒 Privacy First
- Everything runs locally
- Your data never leaves your machine
- No tracking, no analytics

🤖 Custom AI Agents
- Create specialized agents for different tasks
- Each agent uses its expertise in responses
- Unlimited agents, switch anytime

🔧 Claude Code Features
- Execute bash commands
- Read and write files
- Git operations
- All with a beautiful GUI

🔌 Multi-Provider
- Use Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or local Ollama
- Your API keys = pay per use, no subscriptions

📄 Persistent Context
- flaco.md file for project-specific context
- Survives refreshes and new sessions
- Long-term memory for your projects

Perfect for developers who want powerful AI without sacrificing privacy or control.

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I just released Flaco AI v0.0.1 - a desktop app that brings AI coding assistance to a beautiful GUI while keeping everything local and private.

**Why I built this:**

I love Claude Code and terminal AI tools, but they have a steep learning curve. ChatGPT has a great UI but no privacy and limited customization. I wanted something that bridges the gap.

**What it does:**

🔧 **Claude Code Features in a GUI**
- Execute bash commands
- Read/write files
- Git operations (status, diff, commit)
- Shows tool execution inline with expandable blocks

🤖 **Custom AI Agents**
- Create unlimited specialized agents
- Each agent uses its description in responses
- Switch between agents for different tasks
- Great for specialized workflows

📄 **Persistent Context (flaco.md)**
- Add a flaco.md file to your project
- Content loads on every message
- Survives context refreshes
- Long-term memory for your project

🔌 **Multi-Provider**
- Anthropic Claude (best for code)
- OpenAI GPT (familiar and reliable)
- Ollama (100% free, runs locally)

🔒 **Privacy**
- All data stored locally, encrypted
- No cloud sync, no tracking
- Your API keys stay on your machine

**Tech Stack:**
- Electron (desktop app)
- Anthropic SDK
- OpenAI SDK
- Ollama support

**Current State:**
This is v0.0.1 beta. Core features work great. Coming soon: auto-updates, cost tracking, custom icon.

**Download:** https://github.com/RouraIO/flaco.desktop

It's free and MIT licensed. Would love your feedback!

Hey!

I just launched the first version of something I've been working on - Flaco AI.

It's basically a ChatGPT alternative that:
- Runs locally on your Mac (100% private)
- Can execute bash commands, read/write files, do git operations
- Lets you create custom AI "agents" for different tasks
- Uses your own API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, or free local AI)

Think Claude Code but with a beautiful GUI instead of terminal-only.

Download: https://github.com/RouraIO/flaco.desktop/releases/tag/0.0.1

Would love to know what you think! It's free and open source.

Setup takes like 5 minutes - just need an API key from Anthropic or OpenAI (or install Ollama for completely free local AI).

Let me know if you try it!
