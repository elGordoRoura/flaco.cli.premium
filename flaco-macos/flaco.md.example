# Flaco Context File

This file provides persistent context to your Flaco AI agents across all conversations. Place a `flaco.md` file in your project directory to give your agents long-term memory about your project.

## What is this?

`flaco.md` is automatically loaded at the start of every conversation and included in the AI's system prompt. Think of it as your project's long-lived memory that survives context refreshes and new sessions.

## Example Usage

### Project Information
```markdown
# My Awesome Project

This is a Node.js web application built with Express and React.

## Key Files
- `/src/server.js` - Express server
- `/src/client/App.jsx` - React main component
- `/config/database.js` - MongoDB configuration

## Coding Standards
- Use async/await instead of promises
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Write tests for all API endpoints

## Common Tasks
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run build` - Build for production
```

### Personal Preferences
```markdown
## My Preferences
- I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript when adding new files
- Always add JSDoc comments to exported functions
- Use single quotes for strings
- Indent with 2 spaces
```

### Project Context
```markdown
## Current Work
Working on implementing user authentication with JWT.
- Added login endpoint in `routes/auth.js`
- Need to add password hashing with bcrypt
- Need to implement token refresh logic

## Known Issues
- Payment API sometimes times out (investigating)
- Dark mode toggle doesn't persist on reload
```

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your context, the better responses you'll get
2. **Keep It Updated**: Update this file as your project evolves
3. **Use Markdown**: Structure your context with headings and lists
4. **Include Examples**: Show your agents code examples of your preferred style

## Location

Place `flaco.md` in your project's root directory where you're working. Flaco will automatically detect and load it.

**Note:** Delete this file and create your own `flaco.md` with your project's context!
